# CWRParser
Naive parser script which reads a CWR file and finds duplicate assets. Output is two files (unique assets and duplicate assets)

### Install requirements
```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Execute
```python parser.py <name_of_the_cwr_file>```

### Extra notes
CWR input file should be in the same directory otherwise you should provide the absolute path in ```<name_of_the_cwr_file>```
